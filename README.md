## Code
Included is the code necessary to replicate the Seurat or LIGER (or both) objects used for analysis and plotting.
- Each R file specifies version of Seurat/LIGER used for analysis/object creation.
    - Some analyses were performed across multiple versions of Seurat (V2 > V3).  In this scenario objects were updated to V3 using `UpdateSeuratObject`
    - Scripts specify point of upgrade to V3 in regard to analysis or object modification.
    - Seurat V2.3.4 source package can be downloaded here from [CRAN Archive](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Seurat/) and installed from local source.
    - Seurat V3.2+ was released near the end of analysis.  To maintain consistency Seurat V3.1.5 was downloaded from [CRAN Archive](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Seurat/) and installed from local source when switching between V2 and V3 was necessary.  

- Where possible date of analysis performed prior to is specified.  To replicate analyses performed on specific date the following actions are recommended or described in code:
  - Use of contained environment using [packrat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/packrat/index.html) or [renv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/renv/index.html) packages. Followed by date-specific version installation of CRAN packages using [versions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/versions/index.html) package.
  - Archived source versions of specific packages may also be needed depending on version of R and can be downloaded from CRAN archives and installed from local source.

- LIGER analyses were performed using the in development ["online"](https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger/tree/online) branch, updating throughout analysis to accommodate bug fixes.  
  - LIGER analyses also utilize multiple versions of Seurat as specified in code for some of the following situations:
    - Seurat V3 used used for data import, QC filtering (genes, UMIs, % mito), and majority of plotting.
    - Seurat V2 was used during LIGER analysis workflow to accommodate use of now deprecated [`clusterLouvainJaccard` function](https://github.com/samuel-marsh/Marsh_et-al_2020_scRNAseq_Dissociation_Artifacts/tree/master/08_Misc) which relied on Seurat V2 object structure.
    - Conversion between Seurat and LIGER objects was performed using built in LIGER functions `seuratToLiger` and `ligerToSeurat`.

## Data  
### Original Data
The data in this project can be broadly divided into 2 categories (5 sub-projects).  Please see [SI Table 1](LINK) (Mouse; Experiments 1-3) and [SI Table 2](LINK) (Human; Experiments 4-5) for breakdown by sample and more information.

***For experiments 1-4***, all the raw data (fastqs) and expression matrices are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under SuperSeries [GSE152184](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE152184).   

***For experiment 5***, the raw data (fastqs) and expression matrices are available through the European phenome-Genome Archive (EGA) (Accession ID: [EGADXXXXXXX](EGADXXXXXXX))

  5. snRNAseq of surgically resected brain tissue with or without freezing time delay | 10X 3' V3.0 | <br> 4 samples (n= 2; x2 timepoints per sample) | ([EGAXXXXXXX](EGAXXXXXXX))

### Processed Data
**Experiments 1-4**  
All processed data files from Cell Ranger `count` outputs are available via NCBI GEO.  Information on Cell Ranger version and Genome/Annotation for each experiment can be found in each GEO record and [SI Table 1](LINK) or [2](LINK).
There are 3 processed data files per library:
  1. GSM\*\_*Sample-Name*_barcodes.tsv.gz: corresponds to the cell barcodes (i.e. column names).
  2. GSM\*\_*Sample-Name*_features.tsv.gz: corresponds to the gene identifiers (i.e. row names).
  3. GSM\*\_*Sample-Name*_matrix.mtx.gz: expression matrix in sparse format.

### Raw fastq Files
All raw data fastq files can be downloaded from SRA linked from NCBI GEO records or from EGA.
